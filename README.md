# Gesture Recognition System
This repository contains the files used in the developing of a Gesture Recognition System based on s ViViT architecture. This work was developed as Final Degree Project for Telecomunication Degree at the ETSIT-UPM.

## Repository guide
 ### python/
 Contains all scripts used in the project, from the landmarks extrapolation to the model and figure creation. It also contains utility scripts used for the analysis of the dataset.
 ### graphs/
 Contains the graphs generated for the final document.
 ### output/
 The files on this folder are generated by experiments done using the scripts. This scripts execute runs using CNN and LSTM for baseline comparison.
